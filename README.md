# Coffee-Sales-Data-Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of coffee sales spanning from 2019 to 2022. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel with Power Query and Power Pivot to clean and prepare the data. The final output is an interactive dashboard showcasing key insights, such as total sales, trends over time, top-selling coffee types, and customer segmentation by country.

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy using Excel Power Query and Power Pivot.
- **Data Analysis:** Generate insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and coffee product performance.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Visualize the insights in a clear and interactive manner using Excel's built-in chart and dashboard features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following fields:
- **Order ID**
- **Order Date**
- **Customer ID**
- **Product ID**
- **Quantity**
- **Customer Name**
- **Email**
- **Country**
- **Coffee Type Name**
- **Roast Type Name**
- **Size**
- **Unit Price**
- **Sales**

## Process
### 1. Data Cleaning
The raw data contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting. I performed the following data cleaning steps:
- **Missing Values Handling:** Filled in missing data points where possible and removed rows with insufficient data.
- **Deduplication:** Removed duplicate records to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** Standardized fields such as dates and text formats using Power Query.

### 2. Data Analysis
The analysis focused on answering key business questions:
- What is the trend of total sales over the given period?
- Which countries contribute most to coffee sales?
- Which coffee types and roast levels are the most popular?
- Who are the top customers by total sales?
  
Using Excelâ€™s Pivot Tables and Charts, I performed:
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Generated a line graph displaying sales trends across different coffee types over time.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Created a donut chart to segment sales by country.
- **Top Customers:** Displayed a bar chart of the top 5 customers by sales.
  
### 3. Dashboard Creation
The final dashboard presents:
- **Total Sales**
- **Sales Trends Over Time (by Coffee Type)**
- **Sales by Country**
- **Top 5 Customers**
  
The dashboard allows for filtering by year, roast type, and customer loyalty card usage for a more granular view of the data.
